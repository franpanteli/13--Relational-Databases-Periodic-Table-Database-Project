These are my notes on the project task page. This project is called "Build a Periodic Table Database." The URL for the page which these notes are on is https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/build-a-periodic-table-database-project/build-a-periodic-table-database

About this guided project:
	- In this guided project course, we are creating a Bash script 
	- This is to get information about chemical elements from a periodic table database 

To complete the guided project:
	- Copy the project boilerplate code in a Gitpod environment 
	- Open the command palette (command, shift, p)
	- CodeRoad: Start
	- Complete the guided project 

Saving progress: 
	- You have to complete all of the project progress in one go (without backing out of Gitpod)
		- Otherwise your progress might not be saved -> in which case you would have to redo it
