# Relational-Databases-Periodic-Table-Database-Project
## Relational Databases Independent Learning
I independently completed [my thirteenth project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/build-a-periodic-table-database-project/build-a-periodic-table-database) in freeCodeCamp's [Relational Databases course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/), to improve my Bash and SQL skills. This curriculum consisted of 14 guided projects, to be completed in a Gitpod environment. My notes outlining the names (et al) of these guided projects are [here](https://github.com/franpanteli/13--Relational-Databases-Periodic-Table-Database-Project/blob/main/0%20relational-databases-course-overview.txt). This repository is for the thirteenth of these projects I completed as part of this.

## Periodic Table Bash Script
### Problem Solving
For this project, I was provided with an SQL database ([periodic_table.sql](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Periodic-Table-Database-Project/blob/main/periodic_table.sql)). This was designed to contain information about periodic table elements. Periodic table elements were first added to this database. A bash script ([element.sh](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Periodic-Table-Database-Project/blob/main/element.sh)) was then defined, which took periodic table elements as its input and outputted their properties. The commit history for this was then altered and the project files were submitted with tests successfully passing. 

### Solution Workflow 
- To complete this project, I used the CodeRoad extension in a VSCode virtual machine with Gitpod. I exported the project requirements for this as a PDF and [annotated them with my problem solving approaches](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Periodic-Table-Database-Project/blob/main/Task%20Challenge%20Notes.pdf)
- The first stage of this was to make changes to and edit the project database file ([periodic_table.sql](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Periodic-Table-Database-Project/blob/main/periodic_table.sql))
- The second stage of this was to initialise a git repository in the project virtual machine and add several elements to its periodic table database
